# JavaScript IRC Stats

IRC statistics generator powered by JavaScript

## What's the status currently?

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Web-Development-Guru/jsis.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Web-Development-Guru/jsis)


## What is this?

Generates statistics of IRC logs. If you don't know what IRC is, you probably don't care either.


## Why is this?

I grew bored of looking at the old pisg etc. stats. Thought I'd make my own stats, with a more
modern look.

The code in JSIS should also be somewhat easy to manage, and themeing should be pretty easy,
if you get sick of the default theme. There's a widget system for adding content areas, 
e.g. "Most referenced words" in a somewhat simple way.


## Where is it?

The homepage (with links to all important places) is at [http://jsis.name/](http://jsis.name/).
The downloads, code, issue tracker, Wiki, etc. is are available at the [GitHub project page](https://github.com/lietu/jsis)


## What log formats are supported?

JSIS supports the default log formats (with optional seconds in timestamps) of:

 - eggdrop
 - irssi

There is also support for the following formats, but could use a bit more users to confirm that their default format really works:
 - weechat
 - supybot


## What are the requirements, how to use it?

Seems to work with NodeJS v0.6, v0.8 and v0.10.

Read the [installation guide](http://jsis.name/installation.html), basically just run "npm install".


## It is still unclear to me how to use it, can you tell me more?

You can try your luck at finding help through the [GitHub project page](https://github.com/lietu/jsis) .. no promises though


## How about licensing?

Short answer: new BSD, and MIT. Long answer: Read the LICENSE -file

## Do you have an IRC channel?

Yes! While it is small, it exists. [#jsis](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=jsis) @ [Freenode](https://freenode.net/)
